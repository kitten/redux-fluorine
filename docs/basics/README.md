# Basics

Redux Fluorine adds only a single feature: **Agendas**!

You should already know about Observables, since these docs are dependent on
you having a rough idea of what they are. Apart from that this is going
to be very brief and easy.

> Do you need to learn about observables first?
>
> If you require an introduction to observables themselves, you should check
> out the [ReactiveX website](http://reactivex.io/).
